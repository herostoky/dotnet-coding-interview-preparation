Binary search is a highly efficient algorithm for finding an element in a sorted array or list. Here are the situations when using binary search is appropriate:

### 1. **Sorted Data**
Binary search requires that the data be sorted. If the data is not sorted, you need to sort it first, which could impact the overall performance if sorting needs to be done frequently.

### 2. **Large Data Sets**
Binary search is most beneficial with large data sets because it significantly reduces the number of comparisons compared to linear search. It has a time complexity of \(O(\log n)\), which is much faster than the \(O(n)\) complexity of linear search for large \(n\).

### 3. **Frequent Searches**
If you need to perform multiple search operations on the same data set, sorting the data once and then using binary search for each query can be very efficient.

### 4. **Static Data**
Binary search is ideal for static data, where the data set doesn't change often. If the data changes frequently, maintaining the sorted order can be costly in terms of performance.

### 5. **Index-Based Access**
Binary search requires random access to elements (constant time complexity for accessing elements by index). This means it works well with arrays or data structures that allow direct access to elements.

### Use Cases for Binary Search
1. **Finding an Element in a Database Index:**
   When querying a database where the index is sorted, binary search can quickly find the required record.

2. **Searching in a Dictionary:**
   If you have a sorted list of words, binary search can be used to check if a word exists in the list.

3. **Finding a Target in a Sorted Array:**
   For example, checking if a specific value exists in a sorted list of numbers.

4. **Efficient Lookups in Read-Only Data:**
   Situations where the data is loaded once and used multiple times for read-only purposes, such as configuration data loaded at the start of an application.

5. **Searching in a Range:**
   Binary search can be adapted to find the first or last occurrence of a value, or to find the closest value less than or greater than a target.

### When Not to Use Binary Search
1. **Unsorted Data:**
   If the data is unsorted and sorting it is not feasible due to time or space constraints, binary search is not applicable.

2. **Small Data Sets:**
   For very small data sets, the overhead of binary search might not be justified compared to a simple linear search.

3. **Data with Frequent Insertions/Deletions:**
   If the data set is frequently changing, the cost of maintaining sorted order might outweigh the benefits of binary search.

### Conclusion
Binary search is a powerful algorithm when used in the right context. Its efficiency in searching through sorted data makes it a go-to method for many applications, especially when dealing with large and static data sets. However, its requirement for sorted data and efficient random access means it’s not suitable for every scenario. Understanding when and how to apply binary search is key to leveraging its strengths effectively.
