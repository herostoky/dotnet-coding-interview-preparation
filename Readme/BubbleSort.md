Bubble sort is one of the simplest sorting algorithms, but it is generally inefficient for large datasets. Here are situations when you might consider using bubble sort:

### 1. **Educational Purposes**
- **Teaching and Learning**: Bubble sort is commonly used in educational settings to introduce students to the concept of sorting algorithms and algorithm analysis. It helps in understanding basic algorithmic concepts like nested loops and condition checking.

### 2. **Small Data Sets**
- **Very Small Arrays**: If you have a very small array (e.g., fewer than 10 elements), bubble sort's simplicity might make it a reasonable choice. For such small arrays, the performance difference between bubble sort and more efficient algorithms (like quicksort or mergesort) is negligible.

### 3. **Nearly Sorted Data**
- **Arrays That Are Almost Sorted**: Bubble sort can perform well on arrays that are already nearly sorted. In the best case, where the array is already sorted, bubble sort has a time complexity of \(O(n)\).

### 4. **Low Overhead Requirement**
- **Minimal Overhead**: Bubble sort requires very little additional memory overhead (only a few variables), making it suitable in environments with very tight memory constraints.

### 5. **Specific Algorithm Characteristics**
- **Stability**: Bubble sort is a stable sort, meaning it maintains the relative order of equal elements. This can be important in certain applications where the stability of the sorting algorithm matters.

### When Not to Use Bubble Sort

Despite these potential use cases, bubble sort is generally not suitable for most practical applications, especially with large datasets, due to its inefficiency:

1. **Large Data Sets**: Bubble sort has a worst-case and average time complexity of \(O(n^2)\), making it impractical for large arrays.
2. **Performance Critical Applications**: For applications where performance is critical, more efficient algorithms like quicksort, mergesort, or heapsort should be used, which have better time complexities.
3. **General-Purpose Sorting**: For most general-purpose sorting needs, the built-in sorting functions provided by modern programming languages are optimized and much more efficient than bubble sort.

### Conclusion
Bubble sort is best used for educational purposes, very small datasets, nearly sorted arrays, and when minimal overhead is required. For larger datasets or performance-critical applications, more efficient sorting algorithms are recommended.
